# ISO-Loookup-Assistants

This repository provides a pattern template for local data persistence and retrieval of specific ISO values. It is designed to help standardize data sets that may have inconsistent or disparate formatting by offering a consistent lookup mechanism for ISO standards.

## Supported ISO Standards

The template is primarily demonstrated with:
- **ISO 3166**: Country Codes
- **ISO 4217**: Currency Codes

However, the approach is easily adaptable to any commonly used ISO data set, making it useful for a wide range of data normalization and lookup scenarios.

## Use Case

If you frequently work with data sets containing country or currency codes (or any other ISO-based identifiers) that may not be formatted consistently, this repository offers a reusable pattern for local lookup and standardization.
